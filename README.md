# css-javacript-gridLayout-ImageSpan-EventFlip
When I started web development as a hobby (my main job is SoC developer and verification), I went straight to Angular and Reactjs framework.
I realized that my css and javascript knowledge an't solid enough that I always have some troubles for layout.
So I did this simple exercise to build a grid layout image span.
